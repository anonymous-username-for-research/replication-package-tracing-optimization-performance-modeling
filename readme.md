### Application Scenario
Our approach primarily targets performance modeling and regression detection in continuous integration or production environments. In continuous integration, full tracing with higher overhead occurs less frequently (e.g., only once for each release) for identifying performance-sensitive functions. Subsequently, optimized tracing with lower overhead is performed more frequently (e.g., for each commit) to build performance models and detect regressions. The low-overhead optimized tracing can also be applied in production to identify regressions under real-world field workloads; the performance-sensitive functions used in the performance models are determined in a testing environment.

## Methodology
This section provides a brief overview of the methodology. For more details, please refer to the paper.

- **Step 1: Trace Data Collection**: We collect full tracing data for each program execution to identify performance-sensitive functions.

- **Step 2a: Performance-Sensitive Identification**: Leveraging the full tracing data, we identify performance-sensitive functions. we employ four primary dynamic approaches for pruning program functions for tracing and a static one.For dynamic approaches, we determine a function *performance-insensitive* and mark it eligible for removal from tracing if: (1) it consistently performs similarly across different inputs, or (2) it contributes insignificantly to the performance model. For the first aspect, we employ *Shannon's Entropy* and *Coefficient of Variation* metrics. Regarding the second aspect, we analyze the *correlation* among function performance metrics and each function's *feature significance* in a linear regression-based model. We also consider the combinations of these metrics. In addition, for the static approach, we compute multiple performance-related static code features for each function and propose a static performance sensitivity (*StaPerfSens*) score to it. Functions with a score below a certain threshold are deemed performance-insensitive and excluded from tracing.

- **Step 2b: Automatically Finding the Threshold for the Rank-Based Metrics**: *Shannon's entropy*, *CoV*, and *StaPerfSens* pruning methods tend to rank the functions, and accordingly, after measuring them, we have three sets of functions that are sorted based on their *entropy*, *CoV*, or *StaPerfSens*. In order to cluster them into two groups (i.e., *performance-sensitive* and *performance-insensitive*), we use an automated approach to find a statistical threshold to separate them (i.e., using *Ckmeans.1d.dp algorithm*, a one-dimensional clustering method). 
We employ a two-dimensional representation to depict the sorted functions, where the Y values represent the function's metrics (e.g., *entropy*, *CoV*, or *StaPerfSens*), and the X values correspond to the function's indexes in the sorted list (a numeric array). Next, the Y values are smoothed using the *loess* function, and the first derivative of the Y values with respect to the X values is calculated. We use the first derivative to capture the trend of the Y values: a threshold can be made at the point where the decrease of the Y values starts to slow down significantly (i.e., where the absolute value of the first derivative becomes significantly smaller). Smoothing ensures the stability of the derivative values. Subsequently, we use the *Ckmeans.1d.dp algorithm*, a one-dimensional clustering method, to identify a breakpoint separating the derivatives into two clusters. These groups categorize the functions as either performance-sensitive or performance-insensitive. 

- **Step 3: Performance Modeling**: We build performance models using the optimized trace data. We employ the [*PyCaret*](https://github.com/pycaret/pycaret) library to train, tune, and evaluate the models. Also, for model evaluation, we use the *$R^2$* score (the primary metric for model comparisons), *Mean Absolute Error (MAE)*, and *Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE)*.

- **Step 4: Performance Regression Detection**: We evaluate the effectiveness of the performance models in detecting performance regressions. We inject performance regressions into the programs and collect trace data for each input. We then use the performance models to predict the execution time of the programs and compare the errors of predicted values with the actual ones. We employ *Mann-Whitney U test* to determine the statistical significance of the performance regression detection, and *Cliff's Delta Effect Size* to measure the effect size.

## Results
You can find the results of the experiments in the [Analysis Jupyter Notebook](Analysis.ipynb). The notebook contains all the results of our study, including the ones that were not presented in the paper due to space limitations.

## Structure of the Repository Files
### Inputs
The inputs we used for the programs along with their generation scripts. You may check the contained files for more details [here](inputs/).

### Regression Injection
The scripts for injecting performance regressions into the programs. More details of this section is provided inside the [regression-injection](regression-injection/) directory.

### Trace-Data
Contains the trace data collected for each program. For each program we have:
- **vanilla**: Only the baseline information about the program's execution time for each input. It doesn't involve any tracing.
- **analysis**: The trace data which has been captured with full tracing enabled. It consist of 2500 executions (i.e., for each input).
- **optimized**: The trace data after applying the pruning algorithms. There are 333 executions (i.e., for each input) for each pruning method (i.e., entropy, cv, etc.).
- **regression**: Same as optimized, the collected trace data for each input and each pruning method. However, a performance regression was injected for each input.

You can find the trace data for each program in the [trace-data](trace-data/) directory.

### Analysis Jupyter Notebook
The complete notebook for analyzing the trace data (i.e., analysis trace datasets), determining performance-sensitive functions, building performance models (using the optimized trace data), and detecting performance regressions (using the regression trace data). Check the [notebook](Analysis.ipynb) for more details.

### Program Executors
The scripts for running the programs and collecting the trace data. More information about how the scripts work is provided inside the [program-executors](./program-executors/) directory.

**The scripts don't work without having the program's source code (e.g., SPEC CPU 2017)**
